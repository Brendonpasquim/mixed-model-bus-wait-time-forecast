# mixed-model-bus-delay-time-forecast

## Scope

This project implements a set of mixed models that forecast delay time at bus stops in urban public transport.

## Considerations
- `main.Rmd` file is the entry point of the project. Mixed models are called M1, M2, M3 and M3+Sazonality and were developed incrementally.
- `input.csv` file shows the expected data input format;
- This was developed considering the Curitiba - Brazil data model provided by URBS/IPPUC. However, with minor adjustments it should easily fit other datasets.
- This source code is available to be reused and extended, but it is mandatory to give credits to the authors.
  - For academic researchers, it is possible to cite the related white paper.
